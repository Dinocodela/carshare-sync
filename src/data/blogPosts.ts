Insurance is the most important aspect of Tesla car sharing. This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about protecting your investment while earning rental income.

## Understanding Car Sharing Insurance

- No deductible for guest-caused damage over $3,000
- $500-2,500 deductible options for owner flexibility

### Additional Protections
- Lost income reimbursement during repairs
- Diminished value coverage
- Key and fob replacement
- Charging equipment damage

## Cost Breakdown

Insurance costs are automatically calculated based on:
- Vehicle value and model
- Driver age and history
- Rental pricing
- Location risk factors

Typical costs: 15-25% of rental price

## Filing Claims

If damage occurs during a rental:

1. **Document Everything**: Photos of damage, guest communications
2. **Report Immediately**: File claim within 24 hours
3. **Get Estimates**: Authorized Tesla service centers
4. **Track Progress**: Use Teslys dashboard for real-time updates

Average claim processing: 3-7 days

## Protecting Your Tesla

### Pre-Rental Checklist
